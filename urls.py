    # use this pattern, you'll need to create a page in the page tree,
    # and specify its URL (in the Meta Data section) as "/", which
    # is the value used below in the ``{"slug": "/"}`` part.

    # template per page with the template name using the page's slug
    # doesn't apply here, since we can't have a template called
    # "/.html" - so for this case, the template "pages/index.html"
    # should be used if you want to customize the homepage's template.
